# Canvas CSS Class

This plugin do two things : 
- Add the class `.canvas-file` to the body of each canvas file, and adding the attribute `[data-path="filepath"]` 
- Allow you to add custom css class to canvas, using a modal input. Obviously, you can also remove the css-class using the plugin, with the settings or the commands modal.
